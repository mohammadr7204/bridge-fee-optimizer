## 💰 Business Model & Revenue

### How It Works
1. User compares bridge options
2. User clicks best option
3. We track the click with unique ID
4. Bridge pays 10-25% commission on fees
5. Everyone wins (user saves money, bridge gets customer, we earn commission)

### Revenue Projections
- **Month 1**: $0-50 (building partnerships)
- **Month 3**: $300-1,000 (first affiliate deals)
- **Month 6**: $1,000-5,000 (scaling traffic)
- **Year 1**: $10,000+/month (established partnerships)

### Market Opportunity
- **$600B+** annually in cross-chain transfers
- **188% YoY** growth rate
- **$5-20** average user savings per transfer
- **Zero** dedicated competitors with live APIs
